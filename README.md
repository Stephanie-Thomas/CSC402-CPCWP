# CSC402---CPCWP

We are seeking to develop a dynamic leaderboard platform to track and display progress in competitive programming platforms such as LeetCode and CodeForces. The project aims to automatically pull and update performance statistics based on provided usernames, focusing primarily on contest performance, with the option to include additional metrics such as the total number of problems solved. The leaderboard should have the following key features: = Leaderboard Display: A central leaderboard page showcasing participantsâ€™ names and performance metrics. This page would dynamically refresh at configurable intervals (e.g., every few minutes or hours) and can be displayed on a screen in a prominent location such as a hallway. = User Account System: Optionally, participants could create user accounts to store their LeetCode and Code forces usernames, accessed via a private signup link to ensure exclusivity and prevent unauthorized registrations.

Customization and Club Integration:
The platform could be extended to serve as a comprehensive hub for the club, including features such as trophies, photos, and other multimedia to celebrate achievements and foster community engagement.

The system could draw inspiration from our Advent of Code leaderboard (e.g., Advent of Code Private Leaderboard), providing a user-friendly interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. This project offers an exciting opportunity to create a tool that not only promotes healthy competition but also enhances the club's visibility and engagement.
